praise:
  - quote: "Elvery’s transition to the longer novel format is faultlessly executed,
      but some of the fragmentation of the short story medium is retained in her
      luminous, exacting prose, giving it a deeply compelling, unique and almost
      kaleidoscopic tone. The entire book is a haunting and thought-provoking
      achievement: a considered, poignant exploration of the many faces of
      Florence Nightingale, and a powerful vindication of bravery, care and
      women’s work."

    quote: Rich and exacting [...] The physical world of Nightingale is rendered in
      extraordinary detail [...] Nightingale is a luminous, fragmentary
      exploration of what war takes from those who are not asked to fight.
  - quote: "Elvery resists mythmaking. Her Nightingale is not a saint, but a woman
      forged in complexity: brilliant, stubborn, sometimes difficult. The novel
      invites us to see her not as a symbol, but as a person shaped by illness,
      desire, pain and time. Nightingale is not just a novel about Florence
      Nightingale, or about nursing. It’s about the physical and emotional
      labour of care, and the people whose work often goes unnoticed."

Mayfair, 1910. At the age of ninety, Florence Nightingale is frail and no longer of sound mind. After a celebrated career as a nurse, writer and statistician, she now leads a reclusive existence. One summer evening she is astonished to receive a visitor: a young man named Silas Bradley, who claims to have met her during the Crimean War fifty-five years ago. But how can this be? And how does the elusive Jean Frawley connect their two lives?
