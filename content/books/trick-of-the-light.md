  quote: Elvery has a talent for portraying the minutiae of characters’ lives and
    then suddenly stripping the banal away, so that we are left staring at the bare
    bones of a life \[...] Elvery’s debut reads like a triumph of excavation – a collection
    in which dark matter is exposed and subsequently transformed \[...] An intriguing
    and powerful new writer.

An art teacher sends four of her students on a guerrilla mission. A young runner struggles to make sense of his best friend’s death. A health-food company adopts a farcical promotional strategy. A factory worker spends her days applying radioactive paint to watches, while dreaming of a future with her new suitor.

With a keen eye for detail and rich emotional insight, Laura Elvery reveals the fears and fantasies of everyday people searching for meaning.
