        A complex emotional intimacy is present in all of Elvery's stories, but
        it's her inventive characters meeting original circumstances that makes
        *Trick of the Light* that rare thing: a page-turning short fiction
        collection.

      quote: >-
        *Trick of the Light* is at times haunting and poetic, other times bright
        and sharp, and always memorable and hopeful â€¦ This thoroughly profound,
        bold and playful debut pulled me along and pulled me apart.
