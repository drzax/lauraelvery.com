        A complex emotional intimacy is present in all of Elvery's stories, but
        it's her inventive characters meeting original circumstances that makes
        *Trick of the Light* that rare thing: a page-turning short fiction
        collection.

      quote: >-
        *Trick of the Light* is at times haunting and poetic, other times bright
        and sharp, and always memorable and hopeful … This thoroughly profound,
        bold and playful debut pulled me along and pulled me apart.

      quote: >-
        Elvery has a talent for portraying the minutiae of characters’ lives and
        then suddenly stripping the banal away, so that we are left staring at
        the bare bones of a life \[...] Elvery’s debut reads like a triumph of
        excavation – a collection in which dark matter is exposed and
        subsequently transformed \[...] An intriguing and powerful new writer.
